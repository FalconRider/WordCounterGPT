# WordCounterGPT
Just for fun and practice.

A simple word counter written by ChatGPT4 on my instructions. Including the prompt which generated it in 1 pass to show how to code mit Ai.
Total time in getting the idea, typing out the prompt in notepad, cutting and pasting into ChatGPT. About 15 minutes.
Total code generating time - about 15 seconds.

But it is not perfect.
It has a flaw I'll leave in. Might be my fault.
I wanted to use that days date as a version control number.
But the date will reset to any day it's run on, that is it will update.

The  Prompt:
Can you give me the code for an html page, with a little css to make it pretty,
and what ever JavaScript or python you need to make it work.
It would function as a simple Word counter.

Have a large bold title "Word Counter" and a smaller version line stating "Version" and today's date.
It would be a stand alone app that has an input box where I would paste
 a block of text that I had copied to my clipboard from a document. There would be two buttons,
"Count" and "Clear"  and a return area that returns the wordcount of what I'd pasted when
the count button is hit or clears the input field when the Clear button is hit.

So if I pasted " I have a dog ."  it would return 4 words, ignoring the period punctuation mark and any spaces.

Ask me questions if you need to, go to code, in a single  html file with imbedded css and JS , when you have what you need.

It also added comments after the code:

Features:
Title and Version: The page displays a bold title "Word Counter" and dynamically appends today's date to the version line.
Input Box: A large input area to paste the text.
Buttons:
Count: Counts the words in the input while ignoring punctuation and extra spaces.
Clear: Clears the input field and resets the result area.
Responsive Design: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
